		\section{Retrospective}
		\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Time estimation should be taken in to account for each task (user stories should have contained this)}
		\item Tasks should be prioritised so that dependencies are completed first
		\item Time estimation should include the integration of separate tasks
		\item Standup notes should contain realistic goals allowing team mates to accurately predict when a 
		task will be completed
		\item More pair programming and hours spent programming together even when implementing separate tasks
		\item Implement peer reviews
		\item Commenting should be added to code for legibility
		\item Allocate more resources to the project implementation at hand.
		\item Build AI to do project.
		\end{itemize}
